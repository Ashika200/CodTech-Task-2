## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the stock market trends and predicting stock prices using historical data. The analysis employs various techniques such as data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning to provide insights and forecast future trends. Specifically, the project explores Tesla (TSLA) stock data over a defined time period.

The main objectives of this project are:
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on stock price data.
- To visualize trends and patterns in stock prices.
- To apply time series modeling and machine learning techniques for stock price prediction.
- To evaluate the performance of predictive models.

## Project Details

### Dataset
The dataset comprises Tesla (TSLA) stock price data fetched using the Yahoo Finance API for the period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023. The data includes fields such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume.

### Key Tasks
1. **Data Collection**: Fetching stock data using the `yfinance` library.
2. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset, checking for missing values, and generating summary statistics.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating line plots and histograms to explore trends and distributions.
4. **Statistical Modeling**: Building ARIMA models for time series analysis.
5. **Machine Learning**: Implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for stock price prediction.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics and visualizations.

### Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Statsmodels
- TensorFlow (LSTM models)

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Stock_market_analysis.ipynb` to view and execute the code.
